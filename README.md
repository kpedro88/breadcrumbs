# breadcrumbs

A simple script to keep track of working directories in `bash`.
Intended as a lightweight alternative to screen/tmux
for developers working on a number of projects
with different directories/environments.

## Installation

The installation script downloads the `bcs` script, installs it in the specified directory,
and adds the required functions to the logon file (see below).

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kpedro88/breadcrumbs/master/install_bcs.sh
chmod +x install_bcs.sh
./install_bcs.sh -d [directory]
```

Installation script options:
```
-d          installation directory (required)
-f          logon file to install functions (default = ~/.bashrc)
-a          function name for cd + env (default = bcd)
-b          function name for cd (default = bgo)
-e          script name for CMSSW singularity env (default = benv)
-v          version of bcs to install (default = master)
-h          print this message and exit
```

## Usage

`bcs` keeps track of a list of directories in a json file. It can list the directories
(including certain metadata attributes), as well as add, remove, or change associated metadata.
Each directory has a unique label (if not specified, automatically set to the directory path
to ensure uniqueness) as well as a non-unique type (used as a classifier to allow removing
groups of directories). The date a directory was added to the list is also stored, and
newest directories are displayed first. (Re-adding a directory updates its date,
but modifying metadata (label or type) does not change the date.)

The simplest usage is just to call `bcs add` before closing one's terminal or ssh connection,
to keep track of one's last location. This can be automated by including the `bcs add`
call in a logout file. (The "type" attribute can be used to separate directories added
automatically from those added manually, if desired.)
One can then call `bcs list` on login to see the list of breadcrumbs.
The unique labels can be used as keywords if the user does not want to keep track of
the automatic numbering in the list.

When adding a directory, the environment command will be automatically populated with
``eval `scramv1 runtime -sh`â€‹``
if the directory name contains "CMSSW". This can be disabled using the `-E` flag.
If Singularity is needed for a given CMSSW version (determined by checking the base OS),
the environment command will launch the appropriate container (with GPU support, if possible),
and call the above CMSSW environment command.
This is accomplished by a bash script `benv` that is created by the installation script.

A directory in the list can block other related directories from being added to the list.
By default, blocking is not enabled. A directory with a block level of 0 will block any of its subdirectories.
A higher block level will also block subdirectories of the corresponding higher-level directory.
For example, a directory `/A/B/C/D` with a block level of 1 would block all other subdirectories of `/A/B/C`,
while a block level of 2 would block all other subdirectories of `/A/B`.

Examples of the above:

`.bash_login`:
```bash
if type bcs >& /dev/null; then
	bcs list -l
fi
```

`.bash_logout`:
```bash
if type bcs >& /dev/null && [ "$PWD" != "$HOME" ] && [ "$PWD" != "$(readlink $HOME)" ]; then
	bcs add -t auto
fi
```
